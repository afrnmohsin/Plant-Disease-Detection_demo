# Plant-Disease-Detection
*Every farmer must prioritize plant disease management, which is why we have developed a plant disease detection system utilizing Deep Learning. Our advanced approach involves using Convolutional Neural Networks to accurately classify leaf images into 39 distinct categories. The Convolutional Neural Code is built using the Pytorch Framework for seamless implementation. To train our model effectively, we utilized the comprehensive Plant Village dataset, and you can access the dataset link in the Blog section for further details.
